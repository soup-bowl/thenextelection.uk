## Source of Information

The **General Election countdown** information is a rough figure based on information from the [Institute for Government](https://www.instituteforgovernment.org.uk/article/explainer/calling-general-election) guidance on how a general election is called. If the ruling party calls for an early general election, this figure will be updated to reflect that.
